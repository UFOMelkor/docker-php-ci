# Environment

## Memory limit

The default memory limit for PHP has been set to `1024MB`.
You can still [configure it](configuration.md#set-memory-limit).

## Installed Extensions

There is one extension installed by default. It is the **Zip** extension because it is mostly necessary to run composer
and so you will enable it anywhere. You can still [disable it](configuration.md#disable-zip-extension).
